                <p>Lifetime rank is based on a players total points accrued over all previous seasons of tournament play i.e. the player with the most lifetime points will be ranked at number 1. The actual score represents the points accrued for the current
                    season. There is a strong correlation between lifetime rank and actual score. There are a few outliers such as Nemo.
